The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Flat is better than nested.
Although practicality beats purity.
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Complex is better than complicated.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
Sparse is better than dense.
Unless explicitly silenced.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
